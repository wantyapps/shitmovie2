## Scene 0: Intro

Star wars text? Universal theme?
10th Century Fox Sound?

FADE INTO:
## Scene 1: Recap

Shooting: Camera looks at the back of the sofa, and the back of the spies. In front
of them is the TV.

Spy 1 and 2 sit on the sofa watching a movie on the TV (shitmovie1). After 20
seconds of uninterrupted watching, Spy 2 blurts out:
        "This movie is shit."

Spy 1:
        "No swearing!"

Both look at the camera, disappointed.

...

Back to original angle, suddenly.

Spy 1, suddenly (chuckles):
        "I guess you could call it.. heh.. a shitmovie?"

CUT TO:
## Scene 2: Free candy (Beilinson st.)

Shooting: Spies in the even side of the road, camera behind them.
Perp at the entry to Sderot Yael, exchanging rounds.
When car rolls to frame, it obstructs perp, and we can see it run away through
the car's windows.

Spy 1 and 2 are in the middle of a mission.
Very action, mmhm.
Much shooting, very outside.

Suddenly, the ringtone of an ice cream van sounds.

Free Candy Car, through a megaphone:
        "Free candy! Free candy!"

A car with a stuck-on sign saying "FrEe kANdie" on it reverses comically into scene and
stops half off-frame.

Both spies drop their weapons (bananas) and look at the car. The perp runs off
(Sderot Yael) without them noticing.

CUT TO:
## Scene 3: In the car

Easter egg idea: Whilst in the car, when moving, through the window, the viewers
can see an "English book": "New High Five".

Shooting: Both spies in the backseats of the car

Spy 1 and 2 simul.:
        "This candy's gonna be so goooood"

CUT TO:
## Scene 4: Unloading from the car

(Location, behind tapuah pais)
Shooting: 

The car rolls onto a sandy, neglected driveway and halts.

Cut to behind the car:
Both back doors open simultaneously. The spies exit out of the car.

Cut to ground:
Candy is scattered everywhere.

The camera pans up slowly, realizing there is a breadcrumb path of candy,
leading to behind the building.

The spies begin picking up the candies, half eating half placing in their
pockets, following the path.

When the pair reach the end,

Spy 1:
        "Aww, that's it?!"

The camera pans up slowly from the ground, where two large men stand directly
above it with baseball bats, in a confrontational way.

Mysterious Men simul.:
        "Hey punks!"

Mysterious Man 1:
        "Ready to die?"

Spy 2, cutely:
        "Wait, let me finish my gummy bear"
        "Say, d'you have more?"

...
The men look at each other uncomfortably.

Mysterious Man 2:
        "Sorry, that's it."

Tears begin to roll down on Spy 2's face.
Sad small violin music starts playing.


SUDDEN CUT TO:
## Scene 5: Aftermath

The mysterious men lie on the ground bleeding out.

Spy 2 flips his banana and blows on its tip:
        "That was easy."


PAN TO Spy 1:

Spy 1:
        "Well of course it was easy. You didn't do anything!"

...

The spies look at each other, then at the bodies.
Silence.

Suddenly, an iPhone notification sounds. *Ping!*

Spy 2 reaches towards one of the bodies' pocket, swiftly pulling out a phone.

The phone's screen lights up, showing a message.

Zoom onto phone (with hand of Spy 2):

The message reads:
        "BOSS: Iz the job dun?"

Another message pings in:
        "BOSS: ANSER ME NAW!"

EDITOR'S NOTE: The phone needs to be on frame for long enough for the viewers to
decypher the messages.

CUT TO:
## Scene 6: Governor's Kid's room

Shooting: Camera behind Governor's Kid, looking at her laptop.

The room is dark, the only light source being the laptop's screen.
The viewers can _not_ see her face.

Slow zoom in to the screen.

ON THE SCREEN:
The same chat, now from her perspective. A new message is received (by the spies
acting as the hitmen):

Suddenly, a photo is received.
The photo (selfie) details both spies doing a "peace" sign over the awfully dead
bodies.

The spies, via the chat:
        "Man, we don't know who you are, but you need to work on your recruiting
        skills."
        "Seriously, those guys were terrible"
        ...
        ...
        "Anyway, got more candy?"

In the last two couple of miliseconds of the computer being on, her laptop gets a new
message:
        "Suddenly, pineapples."

The Governor's Kid shuts the laptop angrily.

Governor's Kid:
        "Fine, I do it meself."

Shooting: Slow zoom out transition, screen stays in place whilst room around
it switches to "computer expert room" (Tichon office)

TRANS. TO:
## Scene 7: heckerman h4xx0r
Shooting: Camera looks at a different laptop (needs to be _really_ different)
which hosts a "cracking" program, making all kinds of noise (dial-up).

Camera zooms out from computer screen, and pans 180deg backwards, to an
ominous man (hacker). The camera can somehow see the phone connected via
wire to the computer.

The hacker is wearing a fake moustache, so obviously put on that it's funny.

Spy 1 (o.o.f):
        "Is it ready yet?"

Hacker, looking hypnotized by the screen:
        "Well.. kinda"

...

Pan to spies slowly

Spy 2:
        "You look familiar... have we met before?"

Both spies simultaneously tilt their head in confusion.

*QUICK QUICK FLASHBACK TO SHITMOVIE1 SHOOTING WITH GADDY* (needs to be like
2 seconds and black and white).

Immediately after:
Hacker:
        "Uhhh... I don't think so"

Ding! The computer rings and a digital voice sounds, in an arrogant voice.

Digital Voice:
        "The quantum computing has been finalized. Expect info in 105 minutes."

Cut to spies in a terrified face.

Digital Voice:
        "Ha. Just kidding."
Spy 1:
        "Heh, heh."
Digital Voice:
        "A total of one.. file.. has been extracted."
Hacker:
        "Computer, Extract!"
Digital Voice:
        "Nah, I don't feel like it"
        ..
        "Just kidding"

The computer screen lights up with a "notepad"-esqe editor (vim?).

Cut to computer screen (whole frame).

The computer screen shows two lines on a white background.

Spy 1:
        "Are those.. coordinates?"

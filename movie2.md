## Scene 0: Intro

Star wars text? Universal theme?
10th Century Fox Sound?

FADE INTO:
## Scene 1: Recap

Shooting: Camera looks at the back of the sofa, and the back of the spies. In front
of them is the TV.

Spy 1 and 2 sit on the sofa watching a movie on the TV (shitmovie1). After 20
seconds of uninterrupted watching, Spy 2 blurts out:
        "This movie is shit."

Spy 1:
        "No swearing!"

Both look at the camera, disappointed.

...

Back to original angle, suddenly.

Spy 1, suddenly (chuckles):
        "I guess you could call it.. heh.. a shitmovie?"

CUT TO:
## Scene 2: Free candy (Beilinson st.)

Shooting: Spies in the even side of the road, camera behind them.
Perp at the entry to Sderot Yael, exchanging rounds.
When car rolls to frame, it obstructs perp, and we can see it run away through
the car's windows.

Spy 1 and 2 are in the middle of a mission.
Very action, mmhm.
Much shooting, very outside.

Suddenly, the ringtone of an ice cream van sounds.

Free Candy Car, through a megaphone:
        "Free candy! Free candy!"

A car with a stuck-on sign saying "FrEe kANdie" on it reverses comically into scene and
stops half off-frame.

Both spies drop their weapons (bananas) and look at the car. The perp runs off
(Sderot Yael) without them noticing.

CUT TO:
## Scene 3: TODO TODO In the car

Easter egg idea: Whilst in the car, when moving, through the window, the viewers
can see an "English book": "New High Five".

Shooting: Both spies in the backseats of the car

Spy 1 and 2:
        "This candy's gonna be so goooood"
...
Spy 2:
        "Just like that? The mission's over?"
        ..
        "I mean, that guy was pretty good.. It's a shame he got off"
Spy 1:
        "hm."

CUT TO:
## Scene 4: Unloading from the car

(Location, behind tapuah pais)
Shooting: 

The car rolls onto a sandy, neglected driveway and halts.

Cut to behind the car:
Both back doors open simultaneously. The spies exit out of the car.

Cut to ground:
Candy is scattered everywhere.

The camera pans up slowly, realizing there is a breadcrumb path of candy,
leading to behind the building.

The spies begin picking up the candies, half eating half placing in their
pockets, following the path.

When the pair reach the end,

Spy 1:
        "Aww, that's it?!"

The camera pans up slowly from the ground, where two large men stand directly
above it with baseball bats, in a confrontational way.

Mysterious Men simul.:
        "Hey punks!"

Mysterious Man 1:
        "Ready to die?"

Spy 2, cutely:
        "Wait, let me finish my gummy bear"
        "Say, d'you have more?"

...
The men look at each other uncomfortably.

Mysterious Man 2:
        "Sorry, that's it."

Tears begin to roll down on Spy 2's face.
Sad small violin music starts playing.


SUDDEN CUT TO:
## Scene 5: Aftermath

The mysterious men lie on the ground bleeding out.

Spy 2 flips his banana and blows on its tip: (heh heh)
        "That was easy."


PAN TO Spy 1:

Spy 1:
        "Well of course it was easy. You didn't do anything!"

...

The spies look at each other, then at the bodies.
Silence.

Suddenly, an iPhone notification sounds. *Ping!*

Spy 2 reaches towards one of the bodies' pocket, swiftly pulling out a phone.

The phone's screen lights up, showing a message.

Zoom onto phone (with hand of Spy 2):

The message reads:
        "BOSS: Iz the job dun?"

Another message pings in:
        "BOSS: ANSER ME NAW!"

EDITOR'S NOTE: The phone needs to be on frame for long enough for the viewers to
decypher the messages.

CUT TO:
## Scene 6: Governor's Kid's room

Shooting: Camera behind Governor's Kid, looking at her laptop.

The room is dark, the only light source being the laptop's screen.
The viewers can _not_ see her face.

Slow zoom in to the screen.

ON THE SCREEN:
The same chat, now from her perspective. A new message is received (by the spies
acting as the hitmen):

Suddenly, a photo is received.
The photo (selfie) details both spies doing a "peace" sign over the awfully dead
bodies.

The spies, via the chat:
        "Man, we don't know who you are, but you need to work on your recruiting
        skills."
        "Seriously, those guys were terrible"
        ...
        ...
        "Anyway, got more candy?"

In the last two couple of miliseconds of the computer being on, her laptop gets a new
message:
        "Suddenly, pineapples."

The Governor's Kid shuts the laptop angrily.

Governor's Kid:
        "Fine, I do it meself."

Shooting: Slow zoom out transition, screen stays in place whilst room around
it switches to "computer expert room" (Tichon office)

TRANS. TO:
## Scene 7: heckerman h4xx0r

Shooting: Camera looks at a different laptop (needs to be _really_ different)
which hosts a "cracking" program, making all kinds of noise (dial-up).

Camera zooms out from computer screen, and pans 180deg backwards, to an
ominous man (hacker). The camera can somehow see the phone connected via
wire to the computer.

The hacker is wearing a fake moustache, so obviously put on that it's funny.

Spy 1 (o.o.f):
        "Is it ready yet?"

Hacker, looking hypnotized by the screen:
        "Well.. kinda"

...

Pan to spies slowly

Spy 2:
        "You look familiar... have we met before?"

Both spies simultaneously tilt their head in confusion.

*QUICK QUICK FLASHBACK TO SHITMOVIE1 SHOOTING WITH GADDY* (needs to be like
2 seconds and black and white).

Immediately after:
Hacker:
        "Uhhh... I don't think so"

Ding! The computer rings and a digital voice sounds, in an arrogant voice.

Digital Voice:
        "The quantum computing has been finalized. Expect info in 105 minutes."

Cut to spies in a terrified face.

Digital Voice:
        "Ha. Just kidding."
Spy 1:
        "Heh, heh."
Digital Voice:
        "A total of one.. file.. has been extracted."
Hacker:
        "Computer, Extract!"
Digital Voice:
        "Nah, I don't feel like it"
        ..
        "Just kidding"

The computer screen lights up with a "notepad"-esqe editor (vim?).

Cut to computer screen (whole frame).

The computer screen shows two lines on a white background.

Spy 1:
        "Are those.. coordinates?"

Spy 2 to Spy 1:
        "That's probably where their boss is located!"
        ..
Spy 1 replies:
        "I think that's too far-fetched.. Maybe even dangerous."
Spy 2:
        "But... do you think there's more candy there?"

CUT TO:
## Scene 8: Greenscreen montage

*MONTAGE OF SPIES WALKING/CLIMBING/SWIMMING/CYCLING/AIRDROPPING TO LOCATION*

A pirated map is shown on screen whilst the montage is running, on which a
dotted line detailing their path is drawn.

The path is very very ineffective, with many "dead loops", dead ends, and
sounds effects.

Instead of walking two minutes to the _actual_ location, they make a really
bad path.

Throughout all this, Sea Shanty 2 is playing and the spies walk to its tempo.

CUT TO:
## Scene 9:

Shooting: Camera looking at whiteboard (door in frame) of English room.

The room is eerily dark and musty.

Suddenly, the spies kick through the door in an exaggerated motion.

Spy 1 enters the room first, with 2 following right after, with a worried
face.

Spy 1 draws his banana searching for bad guys, and when none are found, he
calmly peels it and eats it.

Spy 2:
        "Why'd you do that, you imebecile?!"
Spy 1 (cutely?):
        (Whilst chewing) "I was hungry!"
..
Spy 1:
        "Are you going to.. eat that?"
Spy 2:
        "You can have my spare."

Spy 2 pulls out another banana from his pocket and gives it to
Spy 1.

Spy 1 embraces the new banana and throws the old one's peel on the floor.

Spy 1:
        "Well, there's no one here."
Spy 2:
        "I think we should look around a bit.."
Spy 1:
        "Sure"

Spy 1 and 2 search under the tables for people, none are found. The camera
follows their perspective (i.e., when they lower their head under the table,
the camera points at their face and follows their movement.)

Spy 1 and 2 begin walking towards the computer of English room, whilst creepy
music is playing in the background.

Suddenly, Spy 2 slips on the banana peel and falls to the floor.

Spy 1 to the now-fallen Spy 2:
        "Ah, you idiot."

Spy 1 crouches to help Spy 2 off the floor. When Spy 2 gets up, he accidentally
bumps the whiteboard cover's handle, causing it to slowly unravel.

Cut to original angle.

The whiteboard cover slowly, even comically so, unveils (in real time, it's
just slow) whilst the Krabby Patty Secret Formula introduction sounds for
30 seconds straight. All this whilst the spies make a dumb "surprised Pikachu"
face.

Multiple camera angles of the now half-unveiled whiteboard shows.

The whiteboard is now completely shown.
Slow zoom in with dramatic music to the Governor's Kid's plan drawn on the
whiteboard in a paranoidic manner (slurred writing, a lot of erasing etc.)

In the middle of the whiteboard is a duct-taped picture of a conspicuous building. (the school's synagogue(RABANOOT) )
Above the picture the words "IviL hq" are written

The title of the plan (on the whiteboard): "IVIL PLeN"


Spy 2:
        "Oh no! An I..v.il? plen?"
Spy 1:
        "I think it says 'Evil plane'"
Spy 2:
        "No, it's definitely an Ivil plan"

Uncomfortable pause (silence).

SPY 2 stares at the picture, before snatching it and turning to head back out the door.

Spy 2 "This might be useful..."

FADE OUT, with a sudden cut in the middle TO:
## Scene 10: Comic break (kinda)

Scene 8 (exactly) is repeated in reverse, and with a faster pace (both audio
and video). This time, the map on screen is not a random map (as in Scene 8),
but is the map from the whiteboard. The idiotic line still does exist and
still gets us to point _b_. The spies do walk in reverse tho. (possibly
the music in reverse too?)

This goes on for around half of the original scene's screen time.

CUT TO

## Scene 11:
Both spies walk blindly holding up the picture of the builing, each side is in a spy's hand.
they walk for a few seconds while the camera looks diagonally from behind the spies at the picture.

suddenly, pineapples

suddenly, both spies halt in their tracks.

Spy 1: 'Hey! isn't that the building in the picture?"

Spy 2: "Why yes, I think it is!"

Spy 1: "What a profound coincidence! our life just seems like a movie!" (breaking the fourth wall sort of)

the spies head down the alley to the right of the synagogue, when nearing the side entarence, a cloaked figure wearing a hoodie & mask passes them (michal, but unknown at the time)

Spy 1: "Hey did you see that?"

Spy 2: "Yeah, let's follow that guy, maybe he can tell us more about this "Ivil plan..."

Spy 1: "NO! I told you, it is an evil plane!"

Spy 2, looking at spy 1 disgustedly: "Whatever." sort of throwing his hand at him in a dissmissive motion.

both spies sneak in behind the figure, heading up the stairwell and into rabanoot
the spies confront the figure who is standing facing the backwall of rabanoot.

Spy 2: "Hey you!"

the figure turns around suprised and speaks in a fabricated lower voice: "Who are you?! What are you doing here?"

Spy 2: "We came to... uh... sorry i forgot."

Figure: "Take your time..."

spy 1 whispers into spy 2's ear 

Spy 2: "Oh right! we came to discover the truth of the ivil plan"

Spy 1 shouts slowly: "E V I L  P L A N E!!!!"

spy 2: "No its obviously ivil plan!"

the figure looks at the spies in confusion as they shout at eachother senselessly

Spy 1: "Okay, okay. you. masked guy, is it 'Evil plane' or 'ivil plan'?"

Figure, in confusion: "Well, uh, it is 'evil plan'"

both spies: "OHHHHHHHH"

spy 2: "that makes more sense..."

Spy 1: "Yeah, anyway you need to come with us to tell us this 'evil plan' of yours."

the figure looks around frantically before starting to run right (from the perspective of the entrance to the room) around the table
the spies begin chasing the figure clockwise around the tables making a sort of cat and mouse chase scene. 
after a few laps the figure runs out the door.
The spies continue the chase, exit out the door and out of the frame.

CUT TO:
## Scene 12:
The figure, and the spies after him, run down the stairs (camera following).
The figure exists the building, spies still following.

She suddenly cuts right, towards the gate of the Democrati school.
She cuts right again, entering the school and leaving the frame.
Cut to front school yard, where the spies continue following her into the building.

Michal goes quickly up the flight of stairs, skipping a few every couple of steps.

The camera follows her, hearing the steps of the spies as well (out of frame).

When they reach the upmost level, invisible cut to next scene

INVIS. CUT TO:
## Scene 13:
Shooting: camera looking towards the wall with the doors. Somehow, the camera
catches all doors at once.

Michal enters the door on the extreme left (26).
Whack-a-mole type chase ensues.

After a few times, michal opens the math room's door, and cuts towards
the stairs.
The spies follow.

Cut to Michal exiting the bulding, spies afer her (again, I know).

Michal runs towards music room, and the chase continues.

She opens the door quickly and closes it shut with a thud.

Camera looking at Michal, after she closed the door. She pants in tiredness.

Suddenly, the beginning of toccata and fugue begins playing.

Swish pan to Gaddy Tzikman, wearing a blone wig and ginger 'stache, playing
on the piano whilst looking at the camera.
After the ending of the first phrase, Michal and Gaddy switch mabatim, doing
absolutely nothing.

7 seconds pass.

Suddenly, the door thuds and the spies enter, panting in tiredness as well.

Gaddy plays the second phrase of toccata and fugue, with the same looks and all.

7 seconds pass.

Spy 2:
        Dude, haven't we seen you before? Like, exactly [exact time, to the second, from when
        the spies saw Gaddy in this movie] ago?
Gaddy, in a squeaking voice:
        Uh.. no.
Spy 1 to Spy 2 and Michal:
        Well, he's got a point.

The four charactes stand uncomfortably in the cramped music room.

Gaddy continues playing the piece, as in practicing it without noticing anyone.
The piece moves to the background.

Michal:
        Ah, finally. We meet at last! You took everything from me! You caused
        me so much pain...

        (flashback monotonic scale plays)

Haze fade to flashback, whilst michal continues babbling in the background.

Flashback:
Michal cries over the body of the governor (previous movie).

Michal (o.o.f):
        My name is Governor Jr. You killed my father. Prepare to d--

BLAM BLAM BLAM!

Cut to music room.

Spy 2 holds his banana still in the recoil position, barrel smoking profusely.

Michal bleeds out on the floor, whilst depressing French music plays.

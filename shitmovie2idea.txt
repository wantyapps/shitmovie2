## Scene 9:

Shooting: Camera looking at whiteboard (door in frame) of English room.

The room is eerily dark and musty.

Suddenly, the spies kick through the door in an exaggerated motion.

Spy 1 enters the room first, with 2 following right after, with a worried
face.

Spy 1 draws his banana searching for bad guys, and when none are found, he
calmly peels it and eats it.

Spy 2:
        "Why'd you do that, you imebecile?!"
Spy 1 (cutely?):
        (Whilst chewing) "I was hungry!"
..
Spy 1:
        "Are you going to.. eat that?"
Spy 2:
        "You can have my spare."

Spy 2 pulls out another banana from his pocket and gives it to
Spy 1.

Spy 1 embraces the new banana and throws the old one's peel on the floor.

Spy 1:
        "Well, there's no one here."
Spy 2:
        "I think we should look around a bit.."
Spy 1:
        "Sure"

Spy 1 and 2 search under the tables for people, none are found. The camera
follows their perspective (i.e., when they lower their head under the table,
the camera points at their face and follows their movement.)

Spy 1 and 2 begin walking towards the computer of English room, whilst creepy
music is playing in the background.

Suddenly, Spy 2 slips on the banana peel and falls to the floor.

Spy 1 to the now-fallen Spy 2:
        "Ah, you idiot."

Spy 1 crouches to help Spy 2 off the floor. When Spy 2 gets up, he accidentally
bumps the whiteboard cover's handle, causing it to slowly unravel.

Cut to original angle.

The whiteboard cover slowly, even comically so, unveils (in real time, it's
just slow) whilst the Krabby Patty Secret Formula introduction sounds for
30 seconds straight. All this whilst the spies make a dumb "surprised Pikachu"
face.

Multiple camera angles of the now half-unveiled whiteboard shows.

The whiteboard is now completely shown.
Slow zoom in with dramatic music to the Governor's Kid's plan drawn on the
whiteboard in a paranoidic manner (slurred writing, a lot of erasing etc.)

In the middle of the whiteboard is a duct-taped picture of a conspicuous building. (the school's synagogue(RABANOOT) )
Above the picture the words "IviL hq" are written

The title of the plan (on the whiteboard): "IVIL PLeN"


Spy 2:
        "Oh no! An I..v.il? plen?"
Spy 1:
        "I think it says 'Evil plane'"
Spy 2:
        "No, it's definitely an Ivil plan"

Uncomfortable pause (silence).

SPY 2 stares at the picture, before snatching it and turning to head back out the door.

Spy 2 "This might be useful..."

FADE OUT, with a sudden cut in the middle TO:
## Scene 10: Comic break (kinda)

Scene 8 (exactly) is repeated in reverse, and with a faster pace (both audio
and video). This time, the map on screen is not a random map (as in Scene 8),
but is the map from the whiteboard. The idiotic line still does exist and
still gets us to point _b_. The spies do walk in reverse tho. (possibly
the music in reverse too?)

This goes on for around half of the original scene's screen time.

CUT TO

## Scene 11:
both spies walk blindly holding up the picture of the builing, each side is in a spy's hand.
they walk for a few seconds while the camera looks diagonally from behind the spies at the picture.

suddenly, pineapples

suddenly, both spies halt in their tracks.

Spy 1: 'Hey! isn't that the building in the picture?"

Spy 2: "Why yes, I think it is!"

Spy 1: "What a profound coincidence! our life just seems like a movie!" (breaking the fourth wall sort of)

the spies head down the alley to the right of the synagogue, when nearing the side entarence, a cloaked figure wearing a hoodie & mask passes them (michal, but unknown at the time)

Spy 1: "Hey did you see that?"

Spy 2: "Yeah, let's follow that guy, maybe he can tell us more about this "Ivil plan..."

Spy 1: "NO! I told you, it is an evil plane!"

Spy 2, looking at spy 1 disgustedly: "Whatever." sort of throwing his hand at him in a dissmissive motion.

both spies sneak in behind the figure, heading up the stairwell and into rabanoot
the spies confront the figure who is standing facing the backwall of rabanoot.

Spy 2: "Hey you!"

the figure turns around suprised and speaks in a fabricated lower voice: "Who are you?! What are you doing here?"

Spy 2: "We came to... uh... sorry i forgot."

Figure: "Take your time..."

spy 1 whispers into spy 2's ear 

Spy 2: "Oh right! we came to discover the truth of the ivil plan"

Spy 1 shouts slowly: "E V I L  P L A N E!!!!"

spy 2: "No its obviously ivil plan!"

the figure looks at the spies in confusion as they shout at eachother senselessly

Spy 1: "Okay, okay. you. masked guy, is it 'Evil plane' or 'ivil plan'?"

Figure, in confusion: "Well, uh, it is 'evil plan'"

both spies: "OHHHHHHHH"

spy 2: "that makes more sense..."

Spy 1: "Yeah, anyway you need to come with us to tell us this 'evil plan' of yours."

the figure looks around frantically before starting to run right (from the perspective of the entrance to the room) around the table
the spies begin chasing the figure clockwise around the tables making a sort of cat and mouse chase scene. 
after a few laps the figure runs out the door, accidentally dropping a note.
when the spies reach the door the figure is nowhere in sight.

Spy 2: "Damn it!... Hey, what's this?" 
spy 2 picks up the note which has written on it: "meet me behind the building at 09:00"

both spies look at eachother

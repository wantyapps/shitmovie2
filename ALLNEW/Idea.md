# Idea for a movie

IDEA: Noam is also an easter egg side character that apperas on many scenes.

i.e. lemonade stand: noam sips from a cup innocently at the edge of the frame.

## Resources

Use two cameras!

More continuity: clothes, props, 

Cam1 Om Cam2 Nom

## Topic

Two  try out with their first heist.

## Characters

Dumb thief/vibe guy - Uri
Smart(er) thief/-- - Gaddy

# Script

## Scene 1 - IN - Van vibes
Idea: Uri wears a pink balaklava.

cam 1: inside car, cam 2: from outside thru window at u&g.

Back of a driving car, the two guys fill the frame, holding long guns.

Uri is vibing with in-ear wired earphones (no music is played to the audience), seeming to enjoy the music in his ears (EYES CLOSED!, head bobbing).

After maybe 15 seconds of this, Gaddy slowly and nonchalantly takes a (maybe disappointed) look at Uri, reaches his hand to Uri's earphones' wire, pulls it from his pocket to reveal it's connected to nothing.

Gaddy, seemingly unsurprised, makes a disappointed look and returns to his original position, Uri still vibing.


(Not-so) suddenly SLOW ZOOM URI'S FACE, Uri seems to smell something (nostrils move), and immediately FAST ZOOM ON EYES opens his eyes.

SLOW ZOOM TO COVER URI BUT NOT GADDY
Uri slowly takes on a retarded smile (open mouth), swings (slowly) his head to the window.

CAMERA POV URI

The camera sees (thru a *closed* window) a small lemonade stand featuring a kid.

FOR LATER
basically, uri and gaddy go out the car, gaddy is getting aggravted by Uri taking stops.
They finish up (noam appears), cut to back to car, and more shenanigans.

Next shenanigan (maybe): Same idea of the wire pulling scene, but gaddy tugs on the wire, doesn't manage to get it out, tugs more and (somehow, we need to film/edit this) pulls out a whole boombox/record player/gammophone/..

FOR TIUL SHNATI, titanic scene (deck-point of "boat")
